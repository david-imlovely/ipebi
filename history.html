<div class="history lead">

    <p>Ayanolu, known as Ayandugba founded ipebi community formally known as Ayandugba community in the 12th century. Ayanperuwa, his son Ayanolu, and his family migrated together with the sons of Oduduwa, Prince Oshifaderin and his brother Prince Oshile, members of their families and other princes and chiefs to found a kingdom. <br>
      Prince Oshifaderin is the head of the group but Ayanperuwa lead the group when are coming from ile ife being a war Lord, he was so powerful and fortified with charms. He is also a traditional healer and he is an entertainer. He has a group of drummers and singers. He made the journey so interesting and exiting. Ayanperuwa died at a place called okeale on their journey and Ayanolu gave birth to Ayankogun at Okeale before their arrival on the present Ijebu Imusin. <br>
      On arrival at the present location of Ijebu imusin, Prince Oshifaderin directed the princes and the chiefs that came with him to set up their own communities, and h built his own palace at Idi-Oko Sangan and named the kingdom IFE OWODAYE. A name similar to his father Oduduwa gave to his own kingdom    IFE –OYELA. <br><br>
      
      The prince and the chiefs set up their distinct communities which include Ipebi, Idoko Aledo, Idoko Ajase, Idoko Olowa, Imeri, Igbaga, Esure, Ijagbure, Itunnagba,  e.t.c <br>
      When Ayanolu found Ipebi, formally known as Ayandugba community, he built an ODI . A house that has no window and door, he entered from top with ladder, it is inside the Odi that he kept his valuables  i.e Charms and war equipments. He build his house at the back of the Odi and people describe his house as the house behind ODI  ( EYIN ODI ) in Ipebi. At Ipebi, Ayanolu gave birth to Ayandelu, Ayanfogun and Ayangalu. <br>
      The set up of the kingdom of Ife Owodaye was so strategic to prevent invasion by other kingdoms. In times of war, they fought together and together they defended their settlements and they inter married and produced offspring from generation to generations. When Prince Oshifaderin established the seat of the kingdom at Idi oko Sangan, he came to Ipebi and he was ushered in through a place called IMERENKO for rituals, sacrifices and other rites to become an OBA. This portion of the land is called IGBO OBA , a place where he waited for a while before the procession started. <br>
      This land is carved out of Igbo Oro Ipebi. After the completion of rites of Oba at Ipebi, he became an Oba and he returned to Idi-Oko Sangan and became the first OBA OLOKO  of Ife Owodaye. All successors of Oba Oloko came to Ipebi for rituals, sacrifices and other rites to become an Oba. After his demise, his son ODUTE succeded him. <br>
      Prince Osile, Oshifaderin’s brother, who settled at  Idoko Atere,  later left to found his own kingdom and he permanently settled down at  Ago-Oko in Abeokuta. <br>
